## Multiplying by Constants
The integer multiplication instruction for many machines may take more than one cycle, unlike other operations.
To improve performance, the compiler can refactor multiplication to a combination of bit shifts and addition/subtraction.

### Multiplying by a power of 2
Multiplication in the form x2^k, for 0 <= k < w, where w is number of bits in the word, and x is an integer, can be represented by a left bit shift, x << k.
This works for both unsigned and two's complement representations.
When shifting left by k for a fixed word size, the higher-order k bits are discarded.

### Generalization
Generating code for an expression x * K, for some constant K:
- The compiler can express K in binary as a combiantion of 0's and 1's
  - For example, 14 can be written as [(0...0)(111)(0)]
- Consider the run of ones from bit position n to bit position m, where n >= m.
  - For the case of 14, we have n = 3, and m = 1 (the initial m is the MSB in the run of ones and m is the LSB).
- The compiler can compute the effect of these bits on the product in two different forms:
  - Form A: (x << n) + (x << (n - 1)) ... (x << m)
  - From B: (x << (n + 1)) - (x << m)

- The compiler decides which form to use depending on the number of operations
  - Generally, if n = m + 1, Form A will be used
  - If n > m + 1, Form B will be used

### Takeaway
You can simply represent the constant in powers of 2.
For example, x * 55. Here, 55 = 2^6 - 2^3 - 2^0, therefore
x * 55 = (x << 6) - ((x << 3) - x); the x here is (x << 0).
